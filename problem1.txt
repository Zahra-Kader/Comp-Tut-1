My honours project is on pulsar timing and gravitational waves. 
In this course I would like to learn more statistics. How can you calculate the mean, standard deviation. Can the chi squared
test be carried out? 
It would also be beneficial to learn to import data and use the data in python if you are aiming to fit the data to a model 
that you created.
